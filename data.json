Some legal requirements can mandate (e.g., nondiscrimination, data privacy and security controls) documentation, disclosure, and increased AI system transparency. These requirements are complex and may not be applicable or differ across applications and contexts. \n \nFor example, AI system testing processes for bias measurement, such as disparate impact, are not applied uniformly within the legal context. Disparate impact is broadly defined as a facially neutral policy or practice that disproportionately harms a group based on a protected trait. Notably, some modeling algorithms or debiasing techniques that rely on demographic information, could also come into tension with legal prohibitions on disparate treatment (i.e., intentional discrimination).\n\nAdditionally, some intended users of AI systems may not have consistent or reliable access to fundamental internet technologies (a phenomenon widely described as the \u201cdigital divide\u201d) or may experience difficulties interacting with AI systems due to disabilities or impairments. Such factors may mean different communities experience bias or other negative impacts when trying to access AI systems. Failure to address such design issues may pose legal risks, for example in employment related activities affecting persons with disabilities.",

Risk tolerance rating policies consider different sources of risk, (e.g., financial, operational, safety and wellbeing, business, reputational, or model risks). A typical risk measurement approach entails the multiplication, or qualitative combination, of measured or estimated impact and likelihood of impacts into a risk score (risk \u2248 impact x likelihood). This score is then placed on a risk scale. Scales for risk may be qualitative, such as red-amber-green (RAG), or may entail simulations or econometric approaches.

For example, \u201ceffective challenge,\u201d is a culture- based practice that encourages critical thinking and questioning of important design and implementation decisions by experts with the authority and stature to make such changes.\n\nRed-teaming is another risk measurement and management approach. This practice consists of adversarial testing of AI systems under stress conditions to seek out failure modes or vulnerabilities in the system. Red-teams are composed of external experts or personnel who are independent from internal AI actors.",

Context mapping is the first step in this effort, and may include examination of the following: \n\n* intended purpose and impact of system use. \n* concept of operations. \n* intended, prospective, and actual deployment setting. \n* requirements for system deployment and operation. \n* end user and operator expectations. \n* specific set or types of end users. \n* potential negative impacts to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and society \u2013 or context-specific impacts such as legal requirements or impacts to the environment. \n* unanticipated, downstream, or other unknown contextual factors.\n* how AI system changes connect to impacts. \n\nThese types of processes can assist AI actors in understanding how limitations, constraints, and other realities associated with the deployment and use of AI technology can create impacts once they are deployed or operate in the real world. When coupled with the enhanced organizational culture resulting from the established policies and procedures in the Govern function, the Map function can provide opportunities to foster and instill new perspectives, activities, and skills for approaching risks and impacts. \n\nContext mapping also includes discussion and consideration of non-AI or  non-technology alternatives especially as related to whether the given context is narrow enough to manage AI and its potential negative impacts. Non-AI alternatives may include capturing and evaluating information using semi-autonomous or mostly-manual methods.",

The interdependencies between these activities, and among the relevant AI actors and organizations, can make it difficult to reliably anticipate potential impacts of AI systems. For example, early decisions in identifying the purpose and objective of an AI system can alter its behavior and capabilities, and the dynamics of deployment setting (such as end users or impacted individuals) can shape the positive or negative impacts of AI system decisions. As a result, the best intentions within one dimension of the AI lifecycle can be undermined via interactions with decisions and conditions in other, later activities. This complexity and varying levels of visibility can introduce uncertainty. And, once deployed and in use, AI systems may sometimes perform poorly, manifest unanticipated negative impacts, or violate legal or ethical norms. These risks and incidents can result from a variety of factors. For example, downstream decisions can be influenced by end user over-trust or under-trust, and other complexities related to AI-supported decision-making.\n\nAnticipating, articulating, assessing and documenting AI systems\u2019 knowledge limits and how system output may be utilized and overseen by humans can help mitigate the uncertainty associated with the realities of AI system deployments.

Testing and evaluation methodologies and metrics therefore address a continuum of activities. TEVV is enhanced when key metrics for performance, safety, and reliability are interpreted in a socio-technical context and not confined to the boundaries of the AI system pipeline. \n\nOther challenges for managing AI risks relate to dependence on large scale datasets, which can impact data quality and validity concerns. The difficulty of finding the \u201cright\u201d data may lead AI actors to select datasets based more on accessibility and availability than on suitability for operationalizing the phenomenon that the AI system intends to support or inform. Such decisions could contribute to an environment where the data used in processes is not fully representative of the populations or phenomena that are being modeled, introducing downstream risks.

The ability for system users, individuals, or impacted communities to seek redress for incorrect or problematic AI system outcomes is one control for transparency and accountability. Higher level recourse processes are typically enabled by lower level implementation efforts directed at explainability and interpretability functionality. See Measure 2.9.\n\nTransparency and accountability across organizations and processes is crucial to reducing AI risks. Accountable leadership \u2013 whether individuals or groups \u2013 and transparent roles, responsibilities, and lines of communication foster and incentivize quality assurance and risk management activities within organizations.\n\nLack of transparency complicates measurement of trustworthiness and whether AI systems or organizations are subject to effects of various individual and group biases and design blindspots and could lead to diminished user, organizational and community trust, and decreased overall system value. Enstating accountable and transparent organizational structures along with documenting system risks can enable system improvement and risk management efforts, allowing AI actors along the lifecycle to identify errors, suggest improvements, and figure out new ways to contextualize and generalize AI system features and outcomes.",

Standards of fairness can be complex and difficult to define because perceptions of fairness differ among cultures and may shift depending on application. Organizations\u2019 risk management efforts will be enhanced by recognizing and considering these differences. Systems in which harmful biases are mitigated are not necessarily fair. For example, systems in which predictions are somewhat balanced across demographic groups may still be inaccessible to individuals with disabilities or affected by the digital divide or may exacerbate existing disparities or systemic biases.\n\nBias is broader than demographic balance and data representativeness. NIST has identified three major categories of AI bias to be considered and managed: systemic, computational and statistical, and human-cognitive. Each of these can occur in the absence of prejudice, partiality, or discriminatory intent. \n\n- Systemic bias can be present in AI datasets, the organizational norms, practices, and processes across the AI lifecycle, and the broader society that uses AI systems.\n- Computational and statistical biases can be present in AI datasets and algorithmic processes, and often stem from systematic errors due to non-representative samples.\n- Human-cognitive biases relate to how an individual or group perceives AI system information to make a decision or fill in missing information, or how humans think about purposes and functions of an AI system. Human-cognitive biases are omnipresent in decision-making processes across the AI lifecycle and system use, including the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of AI.\n\nBias exists in many forms and can become ingrained in the automated systems that help make decisions about our lives. While bias is not always a negative phenomenon, AI systems can potentially increase the speed and scale of biases and perpetuate and amplify harms to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and society.",
